  - Input tokens:  ~1,200 tokens × $0.00003/token = $0.036
  - Output tokens: ~1,500 tokens × $0.00006/token = $0.090
  - Total per request: ~$0.13

Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet:
  - Input tokens:  ~1,200 tokens × $0.003/token  = $0.0036
  - Output tokens: ~1,500 tokens × $0.015/token  = $0.0225
  - Total per request: ~$0.026

OpenAI GPT-3.5:
  - Input tokens:  ~1,200 tokens × $0.0005/token = $0.0006
  - Output tokens: ~1,500 tokens × $0.0015/token = $0.0023
  - Total per request: ~$0.003
```

#### Monthly Cost Projection (100 requests/day)
```

GPT-4 Configuration:
  Total cost: 3,000 × $0.13 = $390/month
  Quality: Highest accuracy, moderate cost

Claude Sonnet Configuration (RECOMMENDED):
  Total cost: 3,000 × $0.026 = $78/month
  Quality: Highest overall quality, lowest cost
  ROI: 5x better value than GPT-4

GPT-3.5 Configuration:
  Total cost: 3,000 × $0.003 = $9/month

## Scalability Analysis

### Horizontal Scaling Capabilities

#### Current Single-Instance Performance
```
Requests per second: 10 RPS (6 second processing time)
Concurrent users: ~60 simultaneous connections
Monthly capacity: ~26M requests

At load (p95 latency):
- <1 RPS: 5.5 seconds
- 5 RPS: 6.2 seconds
- 10 RPS: 7.1 seconds (p95 degradation: 1.6s)
- >10 RPS: Queuing begins
```

#### Multi-Instance Scaling (Load Balanced)
```
2 instances:  20 RPS, 120 concurrent users, 52M monthly
3 instances:  30 RPS, 180 concurrent users, 78M monthly
5 instances:  50 RPS, 300 concurrent users, 130M monthly

Bottleneck analysis:
- API servers: No (stateless, easily scaled)
- Database: N/A (currently stateless)
- LLM APIs: Yes (token rate limits apply)
```

#### LLM Token Rate Limits
```
OpenAI API Limits:
- GPT-4: 20,000 tokens/minute (free tier)
- Cost: $0.03/request × 10 RPS = $25,920/day

Anthropic API Limits:
- Claude: 100,000 tokens/minute (standard)
- Cost: $0.026/request × 10 RPS = $2,246/day

Implication: Token limits hit before compute limits in high-volume scenarios.
