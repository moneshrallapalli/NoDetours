## STEP 5: Add Environment Variables (5 minutes)

Once deployment is done:

1. In your service dashboard, click **"Environment"** tab (top menu)
2. You'll see "Add Environment Variable" button

### Add your LLM API Key:

**For OpenAI:**
```
Name:  OPENAI_API_KEY
Value: sk-... (paste your OpenAI key)
```
Click "Save"

**OR For Anthropic (Recommended):**
```
Name:  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

## STEP 6: Verify Deployment Works (3 minutes)

1. In your service dashboard, look for your **Service URL**
   - It looks like: `https://nodetours.onrender.com`
   - Click on it to open your app ‚úì

2. Test with a travel query:
   ```
   "Help me plan a 3-day trip to Paris with museums and local food"
   ```

3. Click **"Create Travel Plan"** button

4. **Wait** ~10 seconds (first request is slower)

5. You should see:
   - ‚úÖ Itinerary (day-by-day schedule)
   - ‚úÖ Packing List (what to bring)
   - ‚úÖ Budget Estimate (cost breakdown)
   - ‚úÖ Download Calendar button

**Success?** ‚úì Skip to "What's Next"

**Not working?**
- Check the "Logs" tab in Render for error messages
- Verify API keys are correct (no extra spaces)
- See "Troubleshooting" section below

## STEP 7: Update Your Profile (2 minutes)

### Update README.md

Open your `README.md` file and add at the top (after the title):

```markdown
## Live Demo

Try NoDetours live: **[https://nodetours.onrender.com](https://nodetours.onrender.com)**

Example query: "Help me plan a 7-day trip to Japan focusing on anime sites and local food"
```

### Update GitHub Profile Bio

1. Go to: https://github.com/your-username
2. Click "Edit profile"
3. Update bio to something like:

```

## WHAT YOU'LL SEE

### During Build (2-3 minutes)
```
Building Docker image...
Fetching requirements.txt...
Installing packages...
‚úì Build complete
```

### Service Running
```
‚úì Service is live at https://nodetours.onrender.com
Ready to receive requests
```

### First Request Performance
- **First request**: ~10-15 seconds (normal, cold start)
- **After that**: ~6-7 seconds (normal speed)

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Build Failed
**Check**: Look at the "Logs" tab for error message

**Common causes**:
- Missing dependency ‚Üí Update requirements.txt
- Python version issue ‚Üí Check Procfile matches Render runtime

**Solution**: Fix locally, push to GitHub, redeploy

### Problem: Service Crashes
**Check**: Click "Logs" tab to see error

**Common causes**:
- Missing environment variable ‚Üí Add it in "Environment" tab
- API key not set ‚Üí Verify key is in Environment tab
- API key is invalid ‚Üí Get a new one and update

**Solution**: Fix environment variable, service auto-restarts

### Problem: API Calls Failing
**This is OK!** App still works but without that data

**Examples**:
- No weather data ‚Üí Shows itinerary without weather context
- No maps data ‚Üí Still shows destination info
- No search results ‚Üí Uses general knowledge

**Solution**: Optional APIs failing won't break anything

### Problem: "Service URL not responding"
**Wait**: Takes 2-3 minutes after deployment

**Try**: Refresh page after waiting

**Check**: Are you at the correct URL? (https://nodetours.onrender.com)

---

## COST BREAKDOWN

### Render.com Hosting
- **Starter Plan**: $7/month ‚úì (recommended for this project)
- **Standard Plan**: $12/month (if you want better performance)
- **Free Tier**: Available but services spin down after inactivity

### API Costs (Monthly, 100 requests/day)
- **Anthropic Claude**: ~$78/month ‚úì (best value)
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: ~$390/month (expensive)
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5**: ~$9/month (cheapest but lower quality)
- **Weather API**: Free tier available
- **Google APIs**: Free tier available

**Total Monthly Cost**: ~$85 (Render + Anthropic Claude)

---

## MONITORING

### Check Performance
In Render dashboard:
- **Logs** tab: See what's happening
- **Metrics** tab: CPU, memory, requests
- **Deployments** tab: Deployment history

### Typical Metrics
- CPU: 0-30% (at rest)
- Memory: 150-300 MB
- Response time: 6-7 seconds
- Uptime: 99%+ (very stable)
