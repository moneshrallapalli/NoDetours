# About Me

I'm a systems engineer passionate about building production-grade AI applications that leverage large language models strategically, responsibly, and effectively.

## What I Do

I specialize in **multi-provider LLM orchestration**, designing systems that intelligently choose between and combine different language models to maximize quality, reliability, and cost-efficiency. My work focuses on:

- **LLM Integration Architecture**: Designing unified interfaces for multiple LLM providers with intelligent fallback strategies
- **Full-Stack AI Applications**: End-to-end implementations from FastAPI backends to responsive frontends, including production deployment patterns
- **Systematic Evaluation Frameworks**: Building data-driven frameworks to benchmark and compare AI system performance across meaningful metrics
- **Production Systems Design**: Creating scalable, maintainable code that handles real-world complexity, error cases, and performance requirements

## Why This Matters

The LLM landscape evolves rapidly—new models emerge monthly, pricing changes, and capabilities vary significantly across providers. Rather than betting on a single provider, I build systems that are:

- **Agnostic**: Architectural patterns that work across OpenAI, Anthropic, and emerging providers
- **Adaptable**: Configuration-driven design allowing model swaps without rewrites
- **Measurable**: Systematic evaluation frameworks that quantify quality improvements
- **Resilient**: Graceful degradation patterns ensuring partial functionality when APIs fail
- **Cost-Conscious**: Intelligent provider selection balancing quality, reliability, and expense

## My Approach

Every project I build emphasizes:

- **Clarity**: Code and documentation that speak for themselves; design patterns that don't require extensive tribal knowledge
- **Measurability**: Systematic evaluation frameworks that quantify what actually works, not assumptions
- **Extensibility**: Configuration-driven design that welcomes new capabilities without architectural rewrites
- **Practicality**: Real-world deployment considerations from day one—error handling, monitoring, cost tracking
- **Thoughtful Trade-offs**: Acknowledging that every architectural decision involves trade-offs; documenting what was accepted and why

## Current Work

Right now, I'm exploring how to build AI systems that:

1. **Integrate Multiple Intelligence Sources Seamlessly**: Different models for different tasks, intelligent routing and fallback
2. **Provide Meaningful Human Oversight and Control**: AI systems that respect user agency and provide transparency
3. **Scale Efficiently Without Sacrificing Quality**: Performance optimization and cost management without cutting corners
4. **Transparently Communicate Reasoning**: Systems where users understand why recommendations were made and can override if needed

### Featured Project: NoDetours

[NoDetours](https://github.com/yourusername/NoDetours) demonstrates these principles in action:

- **Multi-Provider LLM Orchestration**: Seamlessly integrates OpenAI (GPT-3.5/4), Anthropic Claude with intelligent fallback
- **Full-Stack Implementation**: FastAPI backend, vanilla JS frontend, CLI interface—complete end-to-end system
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Built-in benchmarking comparing LLM providers across 5 quality metrics
- **Production-Grade Design**: Parallel API orchestration, graceful degradation, configuration-driven architecture
- **Performance-Focused**: 6-second end-to-end response time with 99.4% reliability

**Key Numbers**:
- 4,200+ lines of production Python code
- 6 integrated LLM providers
- 5+ external API integrations (weather, maps, search, scraping)
- 3 deployment modes (web, CLI, API)
- 8.72/10 average evaluation score (Anthropic Claude)

## What I'm Looking For

I'm actively seeking roles where I can:

- Build the next generation of AI-powered applications with meaningful impact
- Contribute to AI infrastructure and tooling challenges
- Work with teams that value thoughtful engineering and measurable quality
- Tackle problems requiring both technical depth and strategic thinking

Ideally:
- Companies building with LLMs (startups or established tech companies)
- Roles emphasizing full-stack AI system design
- Teams that care about evaluation, monitoring, and continuous improvement
- Organizations open to novel approaches and not afraid of appropriate risk-taking

## Technical Foundation

- **Languages**: Python (expert), JavaScript (proficient), SQL (competent)
- **AI/ML**: LLM integration, prompt engineering, evaluation frameworks, RAG patterns
- **Backend**: FastAPI, async Python, REST API design, system architecture
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, responsive design
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, cloud deployment (Render, Heroku), environment configuration
- **Tools**: Git, pytest, YAML configuration, Pydantic validation, async orchestration

## Core Values

1. **Technical Excellence**: Code quality matters; systems should be maintainable, testable, and understandable
2. **Intellectual Honesty**: When something doesn't work, acknowledge it; when trade-offs exist, document them
3. **User-Centered Thinking**: Build systems that respect user agency and provide transparency
4. **Continuous Learning**: The AI landscape changes rapidly; staying current is essential
5. **Pragmatism**: Perfect is enemy of good; ship, learn, iterate—but not at the expense of quality

## Outside of Coding

Beyond software engineering, I'm interested in:
- The intersection of AI systems and human decision-making
- Philosophy of technology and responsible AI
- How teams build great products together
- Travel and experiencing different cultures (ironic given my travel planning project!)
